# A bot for game BGMafia.com</h3>
## Installation:
To run the bot the user requires to have both Python (recommended 3.6) and Selenium (for the bot to work). 
Download selenium using pip install selenium. 
 
## Webdrivers:</h4>
The bot uses chrome webdriver which is located in source/webdrivers/chromedriver however this is for a spesific version of chrome. 
If you are having troubles running it, recommended to dowload the newest version for you. 
 
## Easy Run: 
To run the bot you should use the following format: 
``` python program.py username password ``` 
whereas the username is your username (if contains spaces please use "user name") and so for the password 
the format should be written in command line (cmd). 
To make it easier, we are recommending creating batch file (ends with .bat) and write the following command: 

``` 
python program.py username password 
``` 
 
* Note: if using "python" command doesnt work, replace it with the full python installation path  
For example: C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe
