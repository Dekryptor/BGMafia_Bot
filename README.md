If you are having troubles running it, recommended to dowload the newest version for you.<br>
<br>

To run the bot you should use the following format: ``` python program.py username password ``` <br>
whereas the username is your username (if contains spaces please use "user name") and so for the password<br>
the format should be written in command line (cmd).<br>
To make it easier, we are recommending creating batch file (ends with .bat) and write the following command:<br>
```
python program.py username password

For example: C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe *
